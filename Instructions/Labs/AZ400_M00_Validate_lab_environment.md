# Student lab manual

## Instructions

> **Note**: Start at step 4, if you do already have a **personal Microsoft Account** setup and an active Microsoft Azure Pass subscription linked to that account.

1. Get a new **Azure Pass promocode** from the instructor or other source.
1. Use a private browser session to get a new **personal Microsoft Account (MSA)** at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com).
1. Using the same browser session, go to [https://www.microsoftazurepass.com](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com) to redeem your Azure Pass using your Microsoft Account (MSA). For details, see [Redeem a Microsoft Azure Pass](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo?Length=5). Follow the instructions for redemption. 

1. Open a browser and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), then search at the top of the Azure portal screen for **Azure DevOps**. In the resulting page, click **Azure DevOps organizations**. 
1. Next, click on the link labelled **My Azure DevOps Organizations** or navigate directly to [https://aex.dev.azure.com](https://aex.dev.azure.com).
1. On the **We need a few more details** page, select **Continue**.
1. In the drop-down box on the left, choose **Default Directory**, instead of “Microsoft Account”.
1. If prompted (*"We need a few more details"*), provide your name, e-mail address, and location and click **Continue**.
1. Back at [https://aex.dev.azure.com](https://aex.dev.azure.com) with **Default Directory** selected click the blue button **Create new organization**.
1. Accept the *Terms of Service* by clicking **Continue**.
1. If prompted (*"Almost done"*), leave the name for the Azure DevOps organization at default (it needs to be a globally unique name) and pick a hosting location close to you from the list.
1. Once the newly created organization opens in **Azure DevOps**, click **Organization settings** in the bottom left corner.
1. At the **Organization settings** screen click **Billing** (opening this screen takes a few seconds).
1. Click **Setup billing** and on the right-hand side of the screen select the **Azure Pass - Sponsorship** subscription and click **Save** to link the subscription with the organization.
1. Once the screen shows the linked Azure Subscription ID at the top, change the number of **Paid parallel jobs** for **MS Hosted CI/CD** from 0 to **1**. Then click the **SAVE** button at the bottom. 
1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Security** and click **Policies**.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Third-party application access via OAuth**
    > Note: The OAuth setting helps enable tools such as the DemoDevOpsGenerator to register extensions. Without this, several labs may fail due to a lack of the required extensions.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Allow public projects**
    > Note: Extensions used in some labs might require a public project to allow using the free version.
1. **Wait at least 3 hours before using the CI/CD capabilities** so that the new settings are reflected in the backend. Otherwise, you will still see the message *"No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted"*.

### Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisite for the lab, which consists of the preconfigured Parts Unlimited team project based on an Azure DevOps Demo Generator template.

#### Task 1: Configure the team project
