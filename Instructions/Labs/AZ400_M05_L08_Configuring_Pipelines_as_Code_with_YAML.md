# Lab 01: Configuring Pipelines as Code with YAML

## Lab overview

Azure DevOps supports two types of version control, Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). Here is a quick overview of the two version control systems:

- **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)**: TFVC is a centralized version control system. Typically, team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Branches are path-based and created on the server.

- **Git**: Git is a distributed version control system. Git repositories can live locally (such as on a developer's machine). Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection.

Git is the default version control provider for new projects. You should use Git for version control in your projects unless you have a specific need for centralized version control features in TFVC.

In this lab, you will learn how to establish a local Git repository, which can easily be synchronized with a centralized Git repository in Azure DevOps. In addition, you will learn about Git branching and merging support. You will use Visual Studio Code, but the same processes apply for using any Git-compatible client.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

     ![](images/lab15-storage-acc-2.png)


1. Use the existing **Subscription (1)** and **Resource group** as **AZ400-JumpVM (2)** and **Region** as **westus(3)** and specify new names for **Storage account** as **az400storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (4)** and **File share** as **az400fileshare<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (5)**, as shown in the dialog below. Then select **Create**.
   
     ![](images/az-400-storage.png)

    > **Note:** for a list of regions and their alias, run the following command from the Azure Cloud Shell - Bash:

    ```bash
    az account list-locations -o table
    ```

1. From the **Bash** prompt, in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to create a resource group (replace the `<region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region closest to you such as 'centralus', 'westeurope' or other region of choice).

    ```bash
    LOCATION='<region>'
    ```

    ```bash
    RESOURCEGROUPNAME='az400m05l11-RG'
    az group create --name $RESOURCEGROUPNAME --location $LOCATION
    ```

# Exercise 1: Configure CI/CD Pipelines as Code with YAML in Azure DevOps

In this exercise, you will configure CI/CD Pipelines as code with YAML in Azure DevOps.

## Task 1: Add a YAML build definition

In this task, you will add a YAML build definition to the existing project.

1. Navigate back to the **Pipelines** pane in of the **Pipelines** hub.
1. In the **Create your first Pipeline** window, click **Create pipeline**.

    > **Note**: We will use the wizard to create a new YAML Pipeline definition based on our project.

1. On the **Where is your code?** pane, click **Azure Repos Git (YAML)** option.
1. On the **Select a repository** pane, click **eShopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML**.
1. On the **Configure your pipeline** pane, scroll down and select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File**.
1. In the **Selecting an existing YAML File** blade, specify the following parameters:
    - Branch: **main**
    - Path: **.ado/eshoponweb-ci.yml**
1. Click **Continue** to save these settings.
1. From the **Review your Pipeline YAML** screen, click **Run** to start the Build Pipeline process.
1. Wait for the Build Pipeline to complete successfully. Ignore any warnings regarding the source code itself, as they are not relevant for this lab exercise.

    > **Note**: Each task from the YAML file is available for review, including any warnings and errors.

## Task 2: Add continuous delivery to the YAML definition

In this task, you will add continuous delivery to the YAML-based definition of the pipeline you created in the previous task.

> **Note**: Now that the build and test processes are successful, we can now add delivery to the YAML definition.

1. On the pipeline run pane, click the ellipsis symbol in the upper right corner and, in the dropdown menu, click **Edit pipeline**.
1. On the pane displaying the content of the **eShopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML/.ado/eshoponweb-ci.yml** file, navigate to the end of the file (line 56), and hit **Enter/Return** to add a new empty line.
1. Being on line **57**, add the following content to define the **Release** stage in the YAML pipeline.

    > **Note**: You can define whatever stages you need to better organize and track pipeline progress.

    ```yaml
    - stage: Deploy
      displayName: Deploy to an Azure Web App
      jobs:
      - job: Deploy
        pool:
          vmImage: 'windows-2019'
        steps:
    ```

1. Set the cursor on a new line at the end of the YAML definition.

    > **Note**: This will be the location where new tasks are added.

1. In the list of tasks on the right side of the code pane, search for and select the **Azure App Service Deploy** task.
1. In the **Azure App Service deploy** pane, specify the following settings and click **Add**:

    - in the **Azure subscription** drop-down list, select the Azure subscription into which you deployed the Azure resources earlier in the lab, click **Authorize**, and, when prompted, authenticate by using the same user account you used during the Azure resource deployment.
    - in the **App Service name** dropdown list, select the name of the web app you deployed earlier in the lab.
    - in the **Package or folder** text box, **update** the Default Value to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/Web.zip`.
1. Confirm the settings from the Assistant pane by clicking the **Add** button.

    > **Note**: This will automatically add the deployment task to the YAML pipeline definition.

1. The snippet of code added to the editor should look similar to below, reflecting your name for the azureSubscription and WebappName parameters:

    ```yaml
        - task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
          inputs:
            ConnectionType: 'AzureRM'
            azureSubscription: 'AZURE SUBSCRIPTION HERE (b999999abc-1234-987a-a1e0-27fb2ea7f9f4)'
            appType: 'webApp'
            WebAppName: 'eshoponWebYAML369825031'
            packageForLinux: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/Web.zip'
    ```

1. Validate the task is listed as a child of the **steps** task. If not, select all lines from the added task, press the **Tab** key twice to indent it four spaces, so that it listed as a child of the **steps** task.

    > **Note**: The **packageForLinux** parameter is misleading in the context of this lab, but it is valid for Windows or Linux.

    > **Note**: By default, these two stages run independently. As a result, the build output from the first stage might not be available to the second stage without additional changes. To implement these changes, we will add a new task to download the deployment artifact in the beginning of the deploy stage.

1. Place the cursor on the first line under the **steps** node of the **deploy** stage, and hit Enter/Return to add a new empty line (Line 64).
1. On the **Tasks** pane, search for and select the **Download build artifacts** task.
1. Specify the following parameters for this task:
    - Download Artifacts produced by: **Current Build**
    - Download Type: **Specific Artifact**
    - Artifact Name: **Enter "Website" in the text box**
    - Destination Directory: **$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)**
1. Click **Add**.
1. The snippet of added code should look similar to below:

    ```yaml
        - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
          inputs:
            buildType: 'current'
            downloadType: 'single'
            artifactName: 'Website'
            downloadPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ```
1. If the YAML indentation is off, With the added task still selected in the editor, press the **Tab** key twice to indent it four spaces.

    > **Note**: Here as well you may also want to add an empty line before and after to make it easier to read.

1. Click **Save**, on the **Save** pane, click **Save** again to commit the change directly into the master branch.

    > **Note**: Since our original CI-YAML was not configured to automatically trigger a new build, we have to initiate this one manually.

1. From the Azure DevOps left menu, navigate to **Pipelines** and select **Pipelines** again. 
1. Open the **EShopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML** Pipeline and click **Run Pipeline**.
1. Confirm the **Run** from the appearing pane.
1. Notice the 2 different Stages, **Build .Net Core Solution** and **Deploy to Azure Web App** appearing.
1. Wait for the pipeline to kick off and wait until it completes the Build Stage successfully.
1. Once the Deploy Stage wants to start, you are prompted with **Permissions Needed**, as well as an orange bar saying 
    ```
    This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue to Deploy to an Azure Web App
    ```
1. Click on **View**
1. From the **Waiting for Review** pane, click **Permit**.
1. Validate the message in the **Permit popup** window, and confirm by clicking **Permit**.
1. This sets off the Deploy Stage. Wait for this to complete successfully.

     > **Note**: If the deployment should fail, because of an issue with the YAML Pipeline syntax, use this as a reference:

     ```yaml
    #NAME THE PIPELINE SAME AS FILE (WITHOUT ".yml")

# Exercise 2: Configure Environment settings for CI/CD Pipelines as Code with YAML in Azure DevOps

In this exercise, you will add approvals to a YAML-based Pipeline in Azure DevOps.

## Task 1: Set up Pipeline Environments

YAML Pipelines as Code don't have Release/Quality Gates as we have with Azure DevOps Classic Release Pipelines. However, some similarities can be configured for YAML Pipelines-as-Code using **Environments**. In this task, you will use this mechanism to configure approvals for the Build Stage.

1. From the Azure DevOps Project **EShopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML**, navigate to **Pipelines**.
1. Under the Pipelines Menu to the left, select **Environments**.
1. Click **Create Environment**.
1. In the **New Environment** pane, add a Name for the Environment, called **approvals**.
1. Under **Resources**, select **None**.
1. Confirm the settings by pressing the **Create** button.
1. Once the environment got created, click on the "ellipsis" (...) next to the button "Add Resource".
1. Select **Approvals and Checks**.
1. From the **Add your first check**, select **Approvals**.
1. Add your Azure DevOps User Account Name to the **approvers** field.

    > **Note:** In a real-life scenario, this would reflect the name of your DevOps team working on this project.

1. Confirm the approval settings defined, by pressing the **Create** button.
1. Last, we need to add the necessary "environment: approvals" settings to the YAML pipeline code for the Deploy Stage. To do this, navigate to **Repos**, browse to the **.ado** folder, and select the **eshoponweb-ci.yml** Pipeline-as-Code file.
1. From the Contents view, click the **Edit** button to switch to Editing mode.
1. Navigate to the start of the **Deploy job** (-job: Deploy on Line 60)
1. Add a new empty line right below, and add the following snippet:

    ```yaml
      environment: approvals
    ```

    The resulting snippet of code should look like this:

    ```yaml
     jobs:
      - job: Deploy
        environment: approvals
        pool:
          vmImage: 'windows-2019'
    ```
1. As the environment is a specific setting of a deployment stage, it cannot be used by "jobs". Therefore, we have to make some additional changes to the current job definition.
1. On Line **60**, rename "- job: Deploy" to **- deployment: Deploy**
1. Next, under Line **63** (vmImage: Windows-2019), add a new empty line.
1. Paste in the following Yaml Snippet:

```yaml
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
```
20. Select the remaining snippet (Line **67** all the way to the end), and use the **Tab** key to fix the YAML indentation. 

   The resulting YAML snippet should look like this now, reflecting the **Deploy Stage**:

```yaml
- stage: Deploy
  displayName: Deploy to an Azure Web App
  jobs:
  - deployment: Deploy
    environment: approvals
    pool:
      vmImage: 'windows-2019'
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
            inputs:
              buildType: 'current'
              downloadType: 'single'
              artifactName: 'Website'
              downloadPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
          - task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
            inputs:
              ConnectionType: 'AzureRM'
              azureSubscription: 'AZURE SUBSCRIPTION HERE (b999999abc-1234-987a-a1e0-27fb2ea7f9f4)'
              appType: 'webApp'
              WebAppName: 'eshoponWebYAML369825031'
              packageForLinux: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/Web.zip'
```

21. Confirm the changes to the code YAML file by clicking **Commit** and clicking **Commit** again in the appearing Commit pane.
22. Navigate to the Azure DevOps Project menu to the left, select **Pipelines**, select **Pipelines** and notice the **EshopOnWeb_MultiStageYAML** Pipeline used earlier.
23. Open the Pipeline.
24. Click **Run Pipeline** to trigger a new Pipeline run; confirm by clicking **Run**.
25. Just like before, the Build Stage kicks off as expected. Wait for it to complete successfully.
26. From the appearing pane **Checks and manual validations for Deploy to Azure Web App**, click the **View** button next to this message.click the **Permit** button.
27. Click **Permit** again in the following pop-up.
28. Next, since we have the *environment:approvals* configured for the Deploy Stage, it will ask for an approval confirmation before it kicks off.
29. This is visible from the Pipeline view, where it says **Waiting (0/1 checks passed)**. A notification message is also displayed saying **approval needs review before this run can continue to Deploy to an Azure Web App**. 
30. This allows the Deploy Stage to kick off and successfully deploying the Azure Web App source code.
   > **Note:** While this example only used the approvals, know the other checks such as Azure Monitor, REST API, etc... can be used in a similar way

## Review

In this lab, you configured CI/CD pipelines as code with YAML in Azure DevOps.
