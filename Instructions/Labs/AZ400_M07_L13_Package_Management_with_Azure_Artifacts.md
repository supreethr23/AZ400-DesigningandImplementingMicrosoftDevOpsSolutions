    > **Email/Username**: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    
    > **Password**: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. Run the following to publish the package to the **eShopOnWebShared** feed:

    > **Important**: You need to install the credential provider for your operating system to be able to authenticate with Azure DevOps. You can find the installation instructions at [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099625). You can install by running the following command in the PowerShell window: `iex "& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-artifacts-credprovider.ps1) } -AddNetfx"`

    > **Note**: You need to provide an **API Key**, which can be any non-empty string. We're using **az** here. When prompted, sign in to your Azure DevOps organization.

    ```
    dotnet nuget push --source "eShopOnWebShared" --api-key az eShopOnWeb.Shared.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```

   ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(38).png)

## Task 3: Import an Open-Source NuGet package to the Azure DevOps Package Feed

Besides developing your own packages, why not using the Open Source NuGet (<https://www.nuget.org>) DotNet Package library? With a few million packages available, there will always be something useful for your application.

In this task, we will use a generic "Newtonsoft.Json" sample package, but you can use the same approach for other packages in the library.

1. From the same PowerShell window, navigate to the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** folder, run the following **dotnet** command to install the sample package:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
    ```

1. Check the output of the install process. It shows the different Feeds it will try to download the package:

    ```powershell
    Feeds used:
    https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration5-gz-semver2/newtonsoft.json/index.json
    https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/eShopOnWeb/_packaging/eShopOnWebShared/nuget/v3/index.json
    ```
1. Next, it will show additional output regarding the actual installation process itself.

    ```powershell

    ```
1. The Newtonsoft.Json package got installed in the Packages as **Newtonsoft.Json**. From the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, navigate to the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Project, expand Dependencies, and notice the **Newtonsoft.Json** under the Packages. Click on the little arrow to the left of the Packages, to open the folder and file list.

   ![](images/new-image2.png)

## Task 4: Upload the Open-Source NuGet package to Azure Artifacts

Let's consider this package an "approved" package for our DevOps team to reuse, by uploading it to the Azure Artifacts Package feed created earlier.

1. From the Visual Studio, right-click the new **Newtonsoft.Json** package, and select **Open Folder in File Explorer** from the context menu. You will see the new **Newtonsoft.Json** package with the extension **.nupkg**.

1. Copy the full path from the address bar of the File Explorer window and paste it in notepad.

   ![](images/img6.png)

1. Right click on **newtonsoft.json.X.X.X.nupkg**  and select **Properties** then copy the  **newtonsoft.json.X.X.X.nupkg** file name within the Properties window.

    ![](images/img(7).png)
   
    ![](images/img(8).png)
   
1. Navigate back to notepad where you recorded the path and add one backslash \ after version X.X.X and paste the **newtonsoft.json.X.X.X.nupkg** file name at the end.

1. From the PowerShell window, execute the following command replacing the **[path]** with the one which you recored and modified in notepad:

    ```powershell
    dotnet nuget push --source "EShopOnWebShared" --api-key az [path]
    ```

   ![](images/img9.png)

   > **Note**: This should now result in a successful upload.

    ```text
    Pushing newtonsoft.json.13.0.3.nupkg to 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/_packaging/5faffb6c-018b-4452-a4d6-72c6bffe79db/nuget/v2/'...
