     >**Note**: Navigate to file explorer and copy the path and replace the [path]  with path which you copied from file explorer.
     
     ```
      cd [path]
     ```

      ![](images/file(1).png)
      
19.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, run the following to create a **.nupkg** file from the project.

     ```
      ./nuget.exe pack ./EShopOnWeb.Shared.csproj
     ```

     > **Note**: Disregard any warnings displayed in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window.
     > **Note**: This is a shortcut to package the NuGet bits for deployment. NuGet is highly customizable. To learn more, refer to the [NuGet package creation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/overview-and-workflowhttps:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/overview-and-workflow).

20.  NuGet builds a minimal package based on the information it is able to identify from the project. For example, note that the name is **ESopOnWeb.Shared.1.0.0.nupkg**. That version number was retrieved from the assembly.

     ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(32).png)
       
     >**Note**: If you prompted with the **Error NU5133: NuGet.exe file on path C:\Users\xxxxx\source\repos\EShopOnWeb.Shared\EShopOnWeb.Shared\nuget.exe needs to be unblocked after downloading** then we need to unblock the **nuget.exe(1)** file which we downloaded to the **EShareOnWeb.Shared** folder by selecting **Properties(2)**.

     ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_33.png)

18. Check the **Unblock (1)** and click on **Apply (2)** to save the changes and click on **OK (3)**.

     ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_34.png)
    
19. Now again run the **PowerShell command** from the **step 18** and it will create package successfully.
    
     ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_35.png)

20. After the successful creation of the package, run the following to publish the package to the **EShopOnWebShared** feed. If it Prompted to sign in window login with the following credentials.
    
    > **Email/Username**: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    
    > **Password**: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

    > **Note**: You need to provide an **API Key**, which can be any non-empty string. We're using **AzDO** here. When prompted, sign in to your Azure DevOps organization.

    ```
    ./nuget.exe push -source "EShopOnWebShared" -ApiKey AzDO EShopOnWeb.Shared.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_36.png)

    >**Note**: If you encounter following error **Response status code does not indicate success: 409 (Conflict - 'EShopOnWeb.Shared 1.0.0' cannot be published to the feed because it exists in at least one of the feed's upstream sources. Publishing this copy would prevent you from using 'EShopOnWeb.Shared 1.0.0' from 'NuGet Gallery'. For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=864880 (DevOps Activity ID: 439FD43A-8013-498D-A85E-5D95C93668B8)).** Please follow the following steps.

     - Navigate to the Azure DevOps Portal, browse to **Artifacts**.

25.  Click the NuGet package to display its details.

      ![](images/AZ400_M08_L15_(38).png)

## Task 3: Import an Open-Source NuGet package to the Azure DevOps Package Feed

Besides developing your own packages, why not using the Open Source NuGet (<https://www.nuget.org>) DotNet Package library? With a few million packages available, there will always be something useful for your application.

In this task, we will use a generic "Newtonsoft.Json" sample package, but you can use the same approach for other packages in the library.

1. From the same PowerShell window, navigate to the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** folder, run the following **dotnet** command to install the sample package:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
    ```

1. Check the output of the install process. It shows the different Feeds it will try to download the package:

    ```powershell
    Feeds used:
      https://api.nuget.org/v3/registration5-gz-semver2/newtonsoft.json/index.json
      https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/eShopOnWeb/_packaging/eShopOnWebShared/nuget/v3/index.json
    ```

1. Next, it will show additional output regarding the actual installation process itself.

    ```powershell

    log  : Restored c:\eShopOnWeb\eShopOnWeb.Shared\eShopOnWeb.Shared.csproj (in 294 ms).
    ```

1. The Newtonsoft.Json package got installed in the Packages as **Newtonsoft.Json**. From the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, navigate to the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Project, expand Dependencies, and notice the **Newtonsoft.Json** under the Packages. Click on the little arrow to the left of the Packages, to open the folder and file list.

## Task 4: Upload the Open-Source NuGet package to Azure Artifacts

Let's consider this package an "approved" package for our DevOps team to reuse, by uploading it to the Azure Artifacts Package feed created earlier.

1. From the Visual Studio, right-click the new **Newtonsoft.Json** package, and select **Open Folder in File Explorer** from the context menu. You will see the new **Newtonsoft.Json** package with the extension **.nupkg**.
2. Copy the full path from the address bar of the File Explorer window.
3. From the PowerShell window, execute the following command replacing the path with the one you copied:

    ```powershell
    dotnet nuget push --source "EShopOnWebShared" --api-key az C:\eShopOnWeb\eShopOnWeb.Shared\Newtonsoft.Json\newtonsoft.json.13.0.3.nupkg
    ```

    > **Note**:  This results in an error message:

    ```text
    Response status code does not indicate success: 409 (Conflict - 'Newtonsoft.Json 1.3.0.17' cannot be published to the feed because it exists in at least one of the feed's upstream sources. Publishing this copy would prevent you from using 'Newtonsoft.Json 1.3.0.17' from 'NuGet Gallery'. For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=864880 (DevOps Activity ID: AE08BE89-C2FA-4FF7-89B7-90805C88972C)).
    ```

   >**Note** :When you created the Azure DevOps Artifacts Package Feed, by design, it allows for **upstream sources**, such as nuget.org in the dotnet example. However, nothing blocks your DevOps team to create an **"internal-only"** Package Feed.

1. Navigate to the Azure DevOps Portal, browse to **Artifacts**, and select the **eShopOnWebShared** Feed.

1. Click **Search Upstream Sources**.

1. In the **Go to an Upstream Package** window, select **NuGet** as Package Type, and enter **Newtonsoft.Json** in the search field.

1. Confirm by pressing the **Search** button.

1. This results in a list of all Newtonsoft.Json packages with the different versions available.

1. Click the **left arrow key** to return to the **EShopOnWebShared** Feed.

1. Click the cogwheel to open **Feed Settings**. Within the Feed Settings page, select **Upstream Sources**.

1. Notice the different Upstream Package Managers for different development languages. Select **NuGet Gallery** from the list. Press the **Delete** button, followed by pressing the **Save** button.

1. With these saved changes, it will be possible to upload the **Newtonsoft.Json** package using the NuGet.exe from the PowerShell Window, by relaunching the following command:

    ```text
     dotnet nuget push --source "EShopOnWebShared" --api-key az C:\EShopOnWeb\EShopOnWeb.Shared\Newtonsoft.Json\newtonsoft.json.13.0.3.nupkg
    ```

    > **Note**: This should now result in a successful upload.

    ```text
    Pushing newtonsoft.json.13.0.3.nupkg to 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/_packaging/5faffb6c-018b-4452-a4d6-72c6bffe79db/nuget/v2/'...
    PUT https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/_packaging/5faffb6c-018b-4452-a4d6-72c6bffe79db/nuget/v2/
    Accepted https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<AZURE_DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION>/_packaging/5faffb6c-018b-4452-a4d6-72c6bffe79db/nuget/v2/ 3160ms
    Your package was pushed.
    ```

1. From the Azure DevOps Portal, **refresh** the Artifacts Package Feed page. The list of packages shows both the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** custom-developed package, as well as the **Newtonsoft.Json** public sourced package.
1. From the Visual Studio **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Solution, right-click the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** Project, and select **Manage NuGet Packages** from the context menu.
1. From the NuGet Package Manager window, validate the **Package Source** is set to **EShopOnWebShared**.
1. Click **Browse**, and wait for the list of NuGet Packages to load.
1. This list will also show both the **EShopOnWeb.Shared** custom-developed package, as well as the **Newtonsoft.Json** public sourced package.
