# Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisites for the lab, which consist of the preconfigured **EShopOnWeb** team project based on an Azure DevOps Demo Generator template and a team created in Microsoft Teams.


#### Task 1: Configure the EShopOnWeb project

In this task, you will create a new project named **EShopOnWeb** in Azure DevOps Organization.

1.  Click **Sign in** and sign in with the credentials provided in environment details tab.
    
    > **Email/Username**: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    
    > **Password**: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

2.  On the **Create New Project** page, in the **New Project Name** textbox, type **EShopOnWeb(1)**, select visibilty as **Private(2)** and then click **Create Project(3)**

### Exercise 1: Publish code as wiki

In this exercise, you will step through publishing an Azure DevOps repository as wiki and managing the published wiki.

> **Note**: Content that you maintain in a Git repository can be published to an Azure DevOps wiki. For example, content written to support a software development kit, product documentation, or README files can be published directly to a wiki. You have the option of publishing multiple wikis within the same Azure DevOps team project.

## Task 1: Publish a branch of an Azure DevOps repo as wiki

In this task, you will create Azure Repository and publish a branch of an Azure DevOps repo as wiki.

> **Note**: If your published wiki corresponds to a product version, you can publish new branches as you release new versions of your product. 

1.  Ensure that you are viewing the **EShopOnWeb** team project on the Azure DevOps portal. 

    > **Note**: You can access the project page directly by navigating to the [https://dev.azure.com/<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>/EShopOnWeb]URL.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_04.png)
    
2.  In the vertical menu on the left side of the **EShopOnWeb** pane, click **Repos**.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_05.png)

3.  Click on the **Files(1)** pane, we can see that **EShopOnWeb is empty. Add some code!**. So click **Initialize(2)** to initialize the repository for the first time.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_06.png)
    
4.  Click the **Files(1)** pane. In the branch dropdown list , select **main(2)** branch, and review the content of the main branch.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_07.png)

5.  We will store the Wiki source files in a separate folder within the Repos current folder structure. From within Repos, select **Files**. Notice the **EShopOnWeb(1)** Repo title on top of the folder structure. Select the **elipsis (2)**.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_08.png)

6.  Choose **+New(1) / Folder(2)**, and provide **Documents(3)** as title for the New Folder name. As a repo doesn't allow you to create an empty folder, provide **READ.ME(4)** as New File name. Click to **Create(5)** folder.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_09.png)

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_10.png)
    
7.  The **READ.ME(1)** file will open in the built-in view mode. Since this is stored **'as code'(2)**, you need to **Commit** the changes by clicking the **Commit(3)** button.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_11.png)

8.  In the Azure DevOps vertical menu on the left side, click **Overview(1)**, in the Overview section, select **Wiki(2)**, select **Publish code as wiki(3)**.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_12.png)

9. On the **Publish code as wiki** pane, specify the following **settings** and click **Publish(5)**.
   | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Repository | **EShopOnWeb(1)** |
    | Branch | **main(2)** |
    | Folder | **/Documents(3)** |
    | Wiki name | **EShopOnWeb (Documents)(4)** |

    > **Note**: This will automatically open the Wiki section, and publish the editor, where you can provide a Wiki page title, as well as adding the actual content. Notice you are encouraged to use MarkDown format, but make use of the ribbon to help you with some of the MarkDown layout syntax.
    
    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_13.png)

10.  In the Wiki Page **Title** field, enter **Welcome to our Online Retail Store!**.
    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_14.png)

11.  In the **body(1)** of the Wiki Page, paste in the following text and **Save(2)** it:
    
      ```

12.  This sample text gives you an overview of several of the common MarkDown syntax features, ranging from Title and subtitles (##), bold            (**), italic (*), how to create tables, and more.
13.  **Refresh** your browser, or select any other DevOps portal option and return to the **Overview(1)** and **Wiki(2)** section. Notice you are now presented with the **EshopOnWeb (Documents)** Wiki, as well as having the **Welcome to our Online Retail Store(3)** as **HomePage** of the Wiki.
    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_16.png)

#### Task 2: Manage content of a published wiki
In this task, you will manage content of the wiki you published in the previous task.

1. In the vertical menu on the left side, click **Repos(1)**, ensure that the dropdown menu in the upper section of the **Files(2)** pane displays the **EShopOnWeb(3)** repo and **main(4)** branch, in the repo folder hierarchy, select the **Documents(5)** folder, and select the **Welcome-to-our-Online-Retail-Store!.md(6)** file.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_17.png)

2. Notice how the MarkDown format is visible here as raw text format, allowing you to continue editing the file content from here as well.

   > **Note**: Since the Wiki source files are handled as source code, remember all practices from traditional source control (Clone, Pull Requests, Approvals and more), can now also be applied to Wiki pages.


# Exercise 2: Create and manage a project wiki

In this exercise, you will step through creating and managing a project wiki.

> **Note**: You can create and manage wiki independently of the existing repos. 

## Task 1: Create a project wiki including a Mermaid diagram and an image

In this task, you will create a project wiki and add to it a Mermaid diagram and an image.

1.  On your lab VM, in the Azure DevOps portal displaying the **Overview(1)** and **Wiki(2)** pane of the **EShopOnweb** project, with the content of the **EShopOnWeb (Documents)(3)** wiki selected, at the top of the pane, click the **EShopOnWeb (Documents)** dropdown list header, and, in the drop down list, select **Create new project wiki(4)**. 

      ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_18.png)

2.  In the Page title text box, type **Project Design**.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_19.png)

3.  Place the cursor in the body of the page, click the left-most icon in the toolbar representing the header setting and, in the dropdown list, click **Header 1**. This will automatically add the hash character (**#**) at the beginning of the line.

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_20.png)
    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_21.png)

    ![](images/AZ400_M09_L17_25.png)

7.  **Copy and paste** the following code to insert a mermaid diagram on your wiki.

    ```
    ::: mermaid
     sequenceDiagram
     participant U as User
     participant A as Your app
     participant D as Azure DevOps
     U->>A: Use your app
     A->>D: Request authorization for user
     D-->>U: Request authorization
     U->>D: Grant authorization
     D-->>A: Send authorization code
     A->>D: Get access token
     D-->>A: Send access token
     A->>D: Call REST API with access token
     D-->>A: Respond to REST API
     A-->>U: Relay REST API response
    :::
    ```

    >**Note**: For details regarding the Mermaid syntax, refer to [About Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

8.  To the right of the editor pane, in the preview pane, click **Load diagram** and review the outcome. 

    >**Note**: The output should resemble the flowchart that illustrates how to [Authorize access to REST APIs with OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops)
